A super simple background app. I made it for fun in an hour. It tracks the time spent in active programs. To launch it, drop it into a random folder and double-click the .exe file. Bingo, it works.

P.S.: I added encryption just for fun so it couldn't be easily changed manually.
P.s.s: It takes up only 700 kilobytes of RAM.
